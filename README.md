# Test

This is a simple test project to manage company employees

## How it works

I'm currently working on some documentation for the requests.

For convenience, I use a live API server running at [dummy.restapiexample](https://dummy.restapiexample.com/) for the application to make requests against.
If you want to change the API URL to a local server, simply edit src/environments/environment.ts and change api_url to the local server's URL (i.e. localhost:4200/api).

## Running the app

### development
 npm run start

### watch mode
 npm run start:dev

### production mode
 npm run start:prod
